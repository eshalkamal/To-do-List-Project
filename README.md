TO-DO LIST PROJECT

This project is a basic to-do list webpage. It allows users to add tasks, view them, and save them so they don’t forget what needs to be done. The SAVE button is meant to store the written tasks, possibly using the browser’s local storage. The goal of the project is to create a simple task manager that helps users keep track of their daily work.
